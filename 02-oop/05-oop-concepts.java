reference vs object vs instance vs class
  
"class" - a blueprint for a house, using the blueprint(plans) we can build as many houses as we like based on those plan.
  each house you build (in other words "instantiate" using the "new" operator) is an "object" also known as an "instance".
  each house you build has an address (a physical location).
  in other words if you want to tell someone where you live, you give them your address(perhaps written on a piece of paper)
    this is known as a "reference".
  you can copy that "reference" as many times as you like but there is still just one house. 
    in other words, we are copying the paper that has addess on it not the house itself
  we can pass "reference" as "parameters" to "constructors" and "methods"
