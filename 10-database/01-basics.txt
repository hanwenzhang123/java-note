JDBC API - Java Database Connectivity
using JDBC, we can not only work with database, but also spreadsheet and flat files

JDBC acts as a middleman between a Java application and a data source. 
To use a particular data source from an application, we need the JDBC driver for the data source.
    
JDBC contains 2 packages
- java.sql (core JDBC)
- javax.sql (optional JDBC)
The APIs in the javax.sql package are required when working with database servers.
