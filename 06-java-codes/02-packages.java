using "import" to import a package
  like import.util.scanner
  
Reasons to use packages
- programmers can easily determine thaat the classes are related
- it is easy to know where to find the classes and interfaces that can provide the functions provided by the package
- because the package creates a new namespace, class and interface name conflicts are avoided
- classes within the package can have unrestricted acccess to one another while still restricting access for classes outside of package
